# C-Programming

- Define a date structure consisting of day, month, year. Define another structure consisting of the name, 
surname, and birthdate of a person. Define a function that decides whether a certain date is less than another 
date. Write a program that reads the information of your friends from a text file friends.txt, and crates two 
binary files younger.bin and older.bin containing your friends whose are older and younger than you, 
respectively, and displays on the screen the name and surname of your friends who have born in the same 
date as you, if any. Define a function for displaying the content of a binary file containing persons so that 
you can check your work.
